Azure has specilized regions for compliance or legal purposes. A few examples include:

* **US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa and more**: These regions are physical and logical network-isolated instances of Azure for U.S. government agencies and partners. These datacenters are operated by screened U.S. personnel and include additional compliance certifications.

* **China East, China North and more**: These regions are available through a unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet, whereby Microsoft doesn't directly maintain the datacenters.
