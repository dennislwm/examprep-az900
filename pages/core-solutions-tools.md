## Describe core solutions available in Azure

### Describe the benefits and usage of Internet of Things (IoT) Hub, IoT Central, and Azure Sphere

### Describe the benefits and usage of Azure Synapse Analytics, HDInsight, and Azure Databricks

Microsoft Azure suppports a broad range of technologies and services to provide big data and analytic solutions, including Azure Synapse Analytics, HDInsight, and Databricks, and Data Lake Analytics.

#### Azure Synapse Analytics

Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly Azure SQL Data Warehouse) is a limitless analytics service that brings together enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics. You can query data on your terms by using either serverless or provisioned resources at scale. You have a unified experience to ingest, prepare, manage, and serve data for immediate BI and machine learning needs.

#### Azure HDInsight

Azure HDInsight is a fully managed, _open-source_ analytics service that makes it easier, faster, and more cost-effective to process massive amounts of data. You can run popular open-source frameworks and create cluster types such as Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop, Apache Kafka, Apache HBase, Apache Storm, and Machine Learning Services. HDInsight also supports a broad range of scenarios such as extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), data warehousing, machine learning, and IoT.

#### Azure Databricks

Azure Databricks help you unlock insights from all your data and build _AI_ solutions. You can set up your Apache Spark environment in minutes, and then autoscale and collaborate on shared projects in an interactive workspace. Azure Databricks supports Python, Scala, R, Java, and SQL, as well as data science frameworks and libraries including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.

#### Azure Data Lake Analytics

Azure Data Lake Analytics is an on-demand analytics job service that enables you to write queries to transform your data and extract valuable insights.  The analytics service can handle jobs of any scale instantly by setting the dial for how much power you need. You only pay for your job when it's running, making it more cost-effective.

## Describe Azure management tools

### Describe the functionality and usage of the Azure Portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, Cloud Shell, and Azure Mobile App

All capabilities that are available in the Azure portal are also available through Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, REST APIs, and client SDKS.

#### Azure Portal

The Azure portal is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools.

* Build, manage, and monitor everything.
* Create custom dashboards for an organized view of resources.
* Configure accessibility options for an optimal experience.
