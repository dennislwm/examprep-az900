# Contribution

Feel free to contribute to existing services or add new ones. Please follow the guidelines when submitting, you can find them in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), and especially the rules about how to select a exam prep service and describe it.

The goal is to have enough details about each exam prep service so students  can choose whether or not the service suits their needs just by reading the description.

Please also have a look to the [List of excluded services](pages/excluded-services.md) where you can find which service has been considered and why it has been rejected.

# Audience Profile

Candidates for this exam should have foundational knowledge of cloud services and how those services are provided with Microsoft Azure. The exam is intended for candidates who are just beginning to work with cloud-based solutions and services or are new to Azure.

Azure Fundamentals exam is an opportunity to prove knowledge of cloud concepts, Azure services, Azure workloads, security and privacy in Azure, as well as Azure pricing and support. Candidates should be familiar with the general technology concepts, including concepts of networking, storage, compute, application support, and application development.

Azure Fundamentals can be used to prepare for other Azure role-based or specialty certifications, but it is not a prerequisite for any of them.

# Skills Measured

The bullets that appear below each of the skills measured are intended to illustrate how we are assessing that skill. This list is not definitive or exhaustive.

Most questions cover features that are General Availability (GA). The exam may contain questions on Preview features if those features are commonly used.
